## Subtitle Utils

This project lets you merge subtitles from 2 different languages
(the text from one language and the timing from another). it was made for my own use-case, but if it can help anyone else out there who
cannot find the right subtitle version for his language then I hope it will be useful.

This project is written using Angular, which mean to use it you will need to have ```npm``` installed. When you made sure to have ```npm```
on your system, simply clone this repo and run inside the project's folder:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

After that, open it in your favorite browser at:
```http://localhost:4200```
